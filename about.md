## Projects

### HackBrazil (2017)

HackBrazil was a (in the time) one month long hackathon that our team of three, 
with the project [InVisum](https://github.com/LionsWrath/invisum-api), a prototype
for a large scale database syncronization and processing system, got to the top 5 
projects, presenting them in Boston at the 
[Brazil Conference](https://www.brazilconference.org/).
Brazil Conference is a annual conference realized at Harvard and MIT to promote
discussion between brazilian leaders and representatives of Brazil's diversity.

### Hackerspace Maringá (2013 - Today)

> "Hackerspaces are community-operated physical places, where people share their
> interest in tinkering with technology, meet and work on their projects, and learn 
> from each other." ([hackerspaces.org](https://hackerspaces.org/))

I am one of the co-founders of the hackerspace in the city of Maringa - Paraná. 
I was the vice-president for one year and president of the organization for almost 
three years. 
This resulted in a thriving laboratory with many projects involving gesture processing, 
robot creation, Internet of Things and courses of programming and robotics open for all.

### Programming Contests

Participated in the following editions of the regional's of the **ACM International 
Collegiate Programming Contest**: 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. Also, I participated in
the related training program in the State University of Maringá to improve my programming 
abilities in C++.

### Speaker

I was invited as a speaker about Hackerspaces and the field of Computer Science 
in the following events: Latin American Free Hardware Forum in 2015 (A sub event 
of the bigger [LATINOWARE](https://twitter.com/latinoware)), opening week of freshman's 
in the course of civil engineering (2017) and the opening week of freshman's in the 
course of electrical engineering (2017).

### Courses

During the years, I helped many courses come to life. Some only as a organizer, 
some as the speaker. Here is a list:
- C Capacitation Focused on Programming Marathons course (2017 - Speaker); 
- Processing course (2016 - Organizer);
- Python programming course (2014 - Organizer);
- Arduino Day: Arduino Introduction course (2014 - Organizer);
- Basic Arduino Course (2014 - Speaker).

### Teacher Assistant

I had a teacher assistant scholarship in the classes of **Architecture and 
Organization of Computers** (2014) for one semester and **Formal Languages and 
Automatons** (2015 - 2016) for four semesters during the undergraduation in UEM.
In UFMG, I was teacher assistant in the graduation class of **Project and 
Analysis of Algorithms** (2018) for students in masters and PhD.

### Google Summer of Code 2019 - KDE

Collaborated to the [ROCS Graph Theory IDE](https://kde.org/applications/en/education/org.kde.rocs), under the mentoring of Tomaz Canabrava
and Adriaan de Groot. More information in [here](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2019/StatusReports/CaioTonetti).

Participated as a volunteer in the organization of the X Latin and American 
Algorithms, Graphs and Optimization Symposium ([LAGOS](http://www.lagos2019.dcc.ufmg.br/))
in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil.
LAGOS is one of the best latino-american symposiums in the field of theoretical 
algorithms, graph theory and optimization. Funded by CAPES, CNPQ and UFMG.

### Google Summer of Code 2020 - KDE

Mentoring one student for the ROCS graph theory IDE. More information in [here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#4532377939869696).
