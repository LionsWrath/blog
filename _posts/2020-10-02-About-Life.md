It has been some time since my last post. Lately I couldn't keep up with the
post routine, as I was with LOTS of things to do, but today I reserved some
time to write what I have been doing, thinking, studying, writing... So, let's
divide this in some sections:

## Google Summer of Code 2020

It was a success! Although I still did not merge my student's code, I will
try to do this until the end of next week. He passed trought all evaluations
with flying colours, finishing all his listed tasks and writing his progress
in his [personal blog](https://dilsonguim.github.io/website/). His tasks 
involved the implementation graph drawing algorithms from scratch by researching 
some related papers. In total, he submitted three graph drawing algorithms 
for general graphs, trees and DAGs, respectively, together with a suite for 
testing the  quality of the configurations. More information about the final state of his 
project in the final [status report](https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2020/StatusReports/DilsonGuimaraes). 
The only thing that makes me sad this year is the virtual mentor summit, as
I was really looking forward to personally knowing more mentors. ):

## Master's Dissertation

Writing my master's dissertation is proving to be a difficult task. Although
I already have most of the results written in personal notebook, the proccess
of formalization, creating examples and literature searching is arduous and
does not help my sanity (neither my sleep schedule) in the middle of this 
pandemic. But little by little I am winning over this monumental challenge.
Today I talked to my advisor and we decided to plan some papers because I
work better with defined deadlines. Recently I got an accepted paper at the
[SBPO 2020](https://sbpo2020.galoa.com.br/) and sent a poster to the 
[LAWCG 2020](https://www.lawcg.mat.br/lawcg20/). My next challenge is to 
write a paper for the [LAGOS 2021](http://eventos.ufabc.edu.br/lagos2021/)
with the most important results of my master's (that will become a chapter
of my dissertation) and eventually group everything for a journal (that has 
yet to be decided). So, this month is *the month* for my dissertation, as 
I have to finish this paper. So good luck me!

## Study

As a way of keeping my sanity and run from my dissertation, I began learning
things that have nothing to do with my dissertation. I choose the specialization
[Mathematics for Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning) 
of the Imperial College of London on Coursera. It is a pricey (for a brazilian) 
course, but the first two courses of the specialization are worth every penny I spent:

- Linear Algebra for Machine Learning;
- Multivariate Calculus for Machine Learning.

Right now I am at the beginning of the third couse, called PCA for Machine
Learning and I have high expectations. I recommend heavily this course
for anyone that want to learn more about machine learning. After this 
specialization I want to try the [Stanford Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?#syllabus) 
course, and I hope that both courses complement each other. 

And, alhought I said about running from my dissertation, I dusted off my
book on [Machine Learning on Complex Networks](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-17290-3) 
that I won with my best tool award in CBSOFT 2018 and began reading him all over 
again. So, yeah, I am still trying to connect everything after all.
Also, I really recommend this book for an incredible introduction of
the intersection between complex networks and machine learning.
You can think complex network as similar to graph theory, but the 
interest lies not in the static properties of the network but on
it's dynamical properties over random walks, tourist walk, epidemic
spreading (!), etc.

## Personal Projects

I am trying to stop all side projects for now to focus on my dissertation.
So, my plants on my automated greenhouse test died (RIP) and I will sow 
more seeds when my life is more calm. My research project with 
Mateus over at University of Bergen (the graph isomorphism one) is also 
stopped, so I will have to check on him later. My hackerspace projects are 
the same. 

Sad Caio is sad. ):

## Personal life

I began exercising over 4 months ago by using the app Freeletics. This
helped me clear my mind and find more energy to do my everyday tasks.
Don't ever forget how important exercises are. Right now I have some
equipments here at home that help my training, but no more than a place
to lie on is needed to begin. Also, I now have a girlfriend. Who the 
fuck begin dating in a pandemic? But, well... It happens (and I love
her).

To wrap this post up, I am after some job. It is not easy to be a 
student without a scholarship, so money and curriculum for the industry 
is currently needed while I don't decide my future. The future is
uncertain, so I need to be prepared. After I defend my masters I will
begin thinking about a PHD, but no sooner.

### Thank you for reading!
